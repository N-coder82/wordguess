## About The Project

Welcome to Word Guess. This is a game, which lets you play a guessing game similar to Wordle using command-line options. There are five letters, and you have six tries to guess the word. If you get it right in 6 tries the game ends and says, "good job", if you fail to complete the word in 6 tries the game ends and says, "you have run out of chances".
